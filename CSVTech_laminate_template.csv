1,"LayerName is the names will be uesd in 3D Layout stackup, should be present.",,,,,,,,,,,
2,"Type, C : Conductor/Metal layer,  V : Via layer, D : Dielectric layer, I : Insulating layer",,,,,,,,,,,
,Dielectric layer (type D) should be never present in this laminate template.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The start and end layer is considered as the adjacent layers,,,,,,,,,,,
,Via Group and SnapViaGroups will be implemented on all Via layers.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Insulating layer is designed to define TSV insulation thickness, it must have a LayerName that have defined in Via Layers, or will be ignore",,,,,,,,,,,
3,LayerMap indicates the layer mapping in GDS file. ,,,,,,,,,,,
,Conductor/Metal and Via layer must have LayerMap value or will be ignore.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Multiple layermap Mapping could set to one layer separated with space, e.g. 86;0 85;0",,,,,,,,,,,
4,"TextLayerMap indicates which layer used to extract net list in GDS, ",,,,,,,,,,,
,the layermap in GDS should have net information.,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"Thickness must set for Metals/Vias layer thickness, the default unit is um.",,,,,,,,,,,
6,Height indicates position of the layer in stackup,,,,,,,,,,,
,All the height will be obtained by accumulating the thickness of Metal and Vias layer (invert order),,,,,,,,,,,
,Manually set the height value is not suggested.,,,,,,,,,,,
